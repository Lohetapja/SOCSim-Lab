# SOCSim-Lab
"NetSecure Lab is a practical cybersecurity project focused on building a small network with an Active Directory setup. It includes analyzing network traffic using Wireshark, comparing secure vs. insecure protocols (HTTP vs. HTTPS, Telnet vs. SSH), and simulating cyber-attacks to learn defense strategies and raw data analysis."
